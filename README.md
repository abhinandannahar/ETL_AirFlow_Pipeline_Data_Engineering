# ETL_AirFlow_Pipeline_Data_Engineering

## Twitter Data Engineering Pipeline using Airflow, Python, and Twitter API

## Designed and implemented a robust data engineering pipeline to extract, process, and store Twitter data using Airflow for orchestration, Python for data processing, and the Twitter API for data extraction.

## Configured Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to schedule and automate daily data ingestion from Twitter, ensuring efficient and reliable data collection.

## Utilized Python to process raw tweet data, including data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and feature extraction to derive insights from user engagement and trends.

## Integrated data storage with a SQL/NoSQL database for structured storage and easy retrieval of processed data, enabling further analysis and visualization.

## Ensured scalability and fault-tolerance in the pipeline by implementing error-handling mechanisms and monitoring workflows using Airflow.

## Conducted testing and performance tuning to optimize pipeline efficiency and ensure minimal downtime.
